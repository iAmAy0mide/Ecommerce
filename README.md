âš  This project is currently in progress. You will constantly see changes. 

This project is built with React, a JavaScript library for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, Express.js (a Node.js framework) to expedite development and improve scalability, and MongoDB as the database.

The primary purpose of this project is to showcase my user management skills in the backend. Hopefully, it will serve as a source of inspiration to someone.
